# mdlisten

`mdlisten(1)` is a command-line utility to issue long-running [Spotlight queries][spotlight-queries] from the command line.
Itâ€™s like [`mdfind(1)`][mdfind] with the `-live` option except that it outputs the absolute path of new results instead of aggregating them into a useless count.

### Install

Run `make` and then `make install`.
By default it installs to /usr/local, install with a customized `PREFIX` like `make install PREFIX=/opt` to change the install location.

### Usage

```
mdlisten <query>
```

### Example

Upload screenshots to your web host as you take them.

``` bash
mdlisten kMDItemIsScreenCapture = 1 | while read -r filename; do
    scp "$filename" you@domain.com:/var/www/domain.com/screenshots
done
```
